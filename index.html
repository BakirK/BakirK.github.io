			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>My name is Bakir Karovic and i live in capital city of 	Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevo. I was born on september 	23rd 1999 in Sarajevo. I want 	to become programmer and I like 	doing Google Code-in 2015 tasks. They are very good for 	beginners like me and for more experienced young 	programmers. 	So far I learned a lot about Linux and I am learning about 	html and css. I am attanding Electrical Engineering School of 	Sarajevo. 	Google Code-in is doing a very good job at 	motivating young people to start coding, because i wouldn't 	be doing this without it so i think it 	is a sucess.
